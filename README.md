# javascript-and-sqlite3
This is a small fullstack project with front written in vanilla javascript (car selling webpage, where you can add a car to sell). All added cars go to the database SQLITE3. Backend uses some express.js. Front and back communicvate via get/post requests. Dependencies need to be installed to backend directory using command "npm install".
